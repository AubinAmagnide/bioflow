### Table of metrics
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The following table shows the summary of the allele coverage and the standard errors for the different number of founders sampled.

### Graph of allele coverage
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The following graph shows the allele coverage (y axis) at different number of founders sampled (x-axis). It should be understood that once we hit the golden line (0.95) and the green line (0.975) we have probably hit the number of founders of our population. Still, if you notice that the line follows a consistent steep you may want to declare the number of founders as the number where the line stabilizes.
